## How to self deploy
Load the dataset from the ML branch with the link that is provided in the notebook.
Preprocess the dataset to prepare for training.
Create a Dataset object for every personality.
Training and validating the model.
Save the model and upload it to a virtual machine on the cloud.
Download the server source code in the cloud branch
Before you run the server you must download python3 in your server
Install all requirement that provide in requirement.txt
Call command python3 main.py, it will load the model and set an API so the application can call for prediction.
If you wanna try the Android app you can download it in the mobile branch
Then built the application using Android studio
The Application calls the API with the text data for prediction and then gets the result from server response.
